    Session architecture is the vendor's, frame-proven on its own drive logs

    latches the EPS because it never produces a state the EPS rejects:

      activation the EPS's CruiseActivated bit is its session-PHASE flag
                 ("executing now"), raised only after it accepts a session.
                 The vendor streams Active=1 with c=0 for up to 2.9 s and
                 waits - our c-gated build deadlocked for two full drives
                 (route 0000000d: 7218 TX frames, all zero). Stream and
                 wait; the bounded request + hands-light arming keep the
                 waiting phase harmless (root cause 16, corrected).
      idle        Config=3, Active=0, lanes 0/0, request 0 streamed
                  unconditionally (their armed-standby posture)
      engage      3-frame ReqPrepare burst with lanes 2/2, then Active=1
                  ~50 ms later - the EPS ack is NOT waited for (EPS
                  LKAS_Prepared stayed 0 for the vendor's entire drive)
      in-session  request = model demand through the driver limit, full
                  authority: they reach -153 against a +166 driver yank and
                  193 absolute, ~8 sign flips in 27 s (smooth)
      dropout     Active->0 then IMMEDIATELY re-burst and re-activate within
                  60-80 ms (twice in the log, zero EPS complaint)
      disengage   request ramps 52->0 over ~80 ms with lanes still 2/2, lanes
                  drop to 0/0, then Active=0

    Every one of our ten TorqueFailed latches was a state the vendor cannot
    produce: armed-silence from yield-to-zero hesitation, an oscillating
    capped request stream (follow-flip kept the lateral loop open), or a
    dithering cold arm. So there is no defense stack here - full-authority
    output, instant exit-and-retry, and the EPS's own declarations
